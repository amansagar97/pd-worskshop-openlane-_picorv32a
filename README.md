# pd-worskshop-openlane-_picorv32a
The following repository consists of steps followed while doing the Advanced Physical Design Using OpenLANE/SKY130 workshop. The workshop focuses on the complete ASIC flow approach from RTL2GDS using open soucrce EDA tools such as OpenLANE/SKY130. RISC-V architechture is followed for designing the the core of PICORV32A.
